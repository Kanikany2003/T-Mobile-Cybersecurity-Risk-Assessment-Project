  <summary><h2> T-Mobile Cybersecurity Case Study</h2></summary>
  <h3> Overview of T-Mobile</h3>
  <p><b>T-Mobile</b> is a leading telecommunications company providing wireless voice, messaging, and data services across the United States and internationally. As one of the largest mobile network operators, T-Mobile serves over <b>100 million customers</b> and operates an extensive <b>5G network infrastructure</b>, handling vast amounts of sensitive customer and enterprise data.</p>

  <h3> Key Aspects of T-Mobileâ€™s Business Operations:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Industry:</b> Telecommunications</li>
    <li><b>Services:</b> Mobile network, 5G broadband, IoT solutions, enterprise communications</li>
    <li><b>Customer Base:</b> Consumers, businesses, and government organizations</li>
    <li><b>Data Handled:</b> Customer account information, payment details, call records, location data</li>
    <li><b>Compliance Requirements:</b> PCI DSS, GDPR, FCC, SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST CSF</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>âš  Why This Project is Needed</h3>
  <p>As a major telecom provider, T-Mobile faces increasing cybersecurity challenges related to <b>data protection, regulatory compliance, and risk management</b>. With cyber threats evolving rapidly, strong security measures are essential.</p>

  <h3> Key Cybersecurity Challenges Faced by T-Mobile:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Data Breaches:</b> T-Mobile has experienced several high-profile breaches compromising millions of customer records.</li>
    <li> <b>Phishing & Credential Theft:</b> Employees and customers are prime targets for social engineering attacks.</li>
    <li> <b>Third-Party Security Risks:</b> Vendors and external partners may introduce supply chain vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li> <b>Regulatory Compliance:</b> Must adhere to strict data privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, PCI DSS) and telecom regulations (FCC, NIST CSF).</li>
    <li> <b>5G Network Security:</b> Expansion of 5G introduces new attack surfaces for cybercriminals.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This project provides a structured approach to evaluating and mitigating risks in T-Mobileâ€™s cybersecurity framework.</p>
